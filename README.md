# Bash PS1 Generator [![Dependency Status](https://david-dm.org/drewhammond/bash-ps1-generator/status.png)](https://david-dm.org/drewhammond/bash-ps1-generator)

Lightweight web-based app to generate and customize cool and colorful Bash prompts. This project should be considered unstable
at best and for all intents and purposes unworking at the moment. It's in need of some tender loving care if anyone wishes to contribute.
